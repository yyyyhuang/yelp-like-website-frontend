**Iteration 1**

1. Progress
    In the iteration 1, our group has designed the workflow and implemented most of the backend. We set up routings, built the APIs to handle HTTP requests, and created CRUD operations for each microservices. We also designed database schemas with MongoDB and deployed sample data onto Atlas.
2. Members' contribution
    - Yingjie Huang:
        - designed backend and database schemas
        - implemented data access objects(DAOs)
    - Wanqing Guo:
        - designed backend and database schemas
        - set up routings and implemented controllers for high level data access
    
3. Issues
    The key issue is that we have not found any free React implementation of the multi-filter component yet. Our group needs to find 3rd party library and React implementation that we can incorporate in the next iteration.
