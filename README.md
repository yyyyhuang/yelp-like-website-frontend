# 2% Milk Team - Yelp-Like Restaurant Recommendation Website
# Team members: Yingjie Huang, Wanqing Guo

**Iteration 1**

1. Progress
    - In the iteration 1, our group has ported starter code (Movie Time boilerplate) and made changes from it for the landing page. We also explored multiple 3rd party libraries that we can integrate.  
2. Members' contribution
    - Yingjie Huang:
        - made changes for the landing page component
    - Wanqing Guo:
        - made changes for the service module
    
3. Issues
    - The key issue is that we have not found any free React implementation of the multi-filter component yet. In next iteration, our group needs to find 3rd party library and React implementation that we can incorporate. Also, we need to integrate Google Map API with the filter function.
